## About

I'm very interested in various problems solving because of my strong education in several research institutes, especially in mathematical modeling and business automation. Computers can give us opportunity to facilitate calculations and provide a convenient interface for solving many routine and boring tasks, so I simply love them.

Programming has always been one of my main tools in problem solving although my responsibilities could be far from pure programming. For example, as an analyst chemist, I decided to abandon filling out paper laboratory journals and automate calculations using Excel, VBA and Python. These solutions began to be used by other people and gradually they even penetrated into other departments.

Later I took part in the implementation of LabWare LIMS (Laboratory Information Managemet System) as department manager and LIMS administrator. Automation of processes has significantly accelerated the issuance of results and facilitated daily processes in the laboratory. So I am interested in further developing my skills as a programmer.
